# Secure_MQTT_Client-TLS
This sketch for ESP32 connects to a secure MQTT server over WiFi using the WiFiClientSecure and PubSubClient libraries. It uses a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for secure communication. The ESP32 subscribes to an MQTT topic and publishes messages, handling incoming messages with a callback function.
